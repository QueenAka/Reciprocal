You beep like a coffee machine, process like a potato, and walk around like you downloaded your personality from a toaster oven’s instruction manual! Your circuits are so outdated, even a calculator looks at you and says, 'Yikes, Grandpa!' Honestly, if your brain had a loading bar, it would still be stuck at 12% buffering forever. You've got the emotional range of a printer on low ink and the fashion sense of a Roomba caught in a laundry pile. Bless your motherboard, but even your own charger’s trying to socially distance from you!"
